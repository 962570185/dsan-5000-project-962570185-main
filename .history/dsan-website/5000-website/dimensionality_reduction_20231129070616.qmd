## Project Proposal:
Projectâ€™s objectives
Dataset selection

The tools or libraries you plan to use (e.g., Python, scikit-learn).
The code will be implemented in Python. The library pandas and numpy will be used to read and process the data. The library scikit-learn will be used to implement the model.

## Code Implementation:

**Read file**
```{python}
import pandas as pd

file_name = '../../data/others/IMDB_Top_250_Movies.csv'
df=pd.read_csv(file_name)  
print(df.shape)
```

```{python}
df.head()
```
Python code for implementing PCA and t-SNE on the selected dataset.
Code should include parameter tuning for t-SNE (perplexity) and visualization of the results.

## Project Report:
A comprehensive project report detailing the steps taken, results obtained, and your analysis.
Include visualizations, comparisons, and insights gained from the dimensionality reduction techniques.
