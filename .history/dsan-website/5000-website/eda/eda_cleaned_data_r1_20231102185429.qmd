There is only one int variable in this dataset, the rest are str variables, so you can't do a correlation analysis.

This dataset is the top 100 ratings on a specialized movie website in China.

1\. Audience Preference for High Quality Movies: Since this is the data of the top 100 movie ratings and the scores are mainly concentrated in the range of 9 to 10, it may indicate that the audience prefers high quality movies on this website.

2\. Professional rating standard: Considering that the scores of most movies are concentrated in a small range, the rating standard of this movie website may be relatively professional and strict.

3\. Possible differences in viewers' rating habits: Even though all these movies are in the top 100, differences in ratings between them still exist. This may mean that viewers have different rating habits, expectations and preferences.

4\. Classics vs. new releases: In the top one hundred, there may be some old classics while some are new releases in recent years. There may be differences in the distribution of ratings between them, which could be an interesting point of hypothesis.

5\. Differences in movie genres: Different types of movies (e.g., action, romance, sci-fi, etc.) may have differences in ratings. One hypothesis is that certain types of movies may be more popular or score higher on this site.

6\. Influence of directors and actors: Some directors or actors may score their movies higher due to their popularity and reputation in the industry. Audiences may be more inclined to give higher scores to movies with well-known directors or actors.

This dataset is mainly ratings and short reviews, there is no other valuable information, I will try to add these data manually later, here is a list of my assumptions first

    count = n(),
    avg_score = mean(score),
    min_score = min(score),

***ANSWER for 8***

#### Introduction:

The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the **`cleaned_data_r1.csv`** dataset. The dataset primarily contains terms and their associated scores, offering insights into sentiments or importance. We delved into the data, uncovering patterns, distributions, and relationships that can help in further research or decision-making.

#### 1. Data Overview:

The dataset comprises terms (or phrases) and their respective scores. A preliminary assessment revealed that the data contains unique terms without any repetition.

#### 2. Data Distribution:

-   **Score Distribution**: Most of the scores lie in the range between 9 and 10. The data indicates a high degree of positivity or favorability in terms.

#### 3. Frequency Analysis:

-   **Keyword Analysis**: A frequency analysis of keywords revealed the most common themes in the terms. Some top keywords included words like "自由" (freedom), suggesting a possible focus on liberty or independence in the context from which this data has been extracted.

#### 4. Grouped Analysis:

Based on the scores, we classified the terms into three main groups:

-   Group 1: Score \> 9.5

-   Group 2: 9.0 \<= Score \<= 9.5

-   Group 3: Score \< 9.0

A keyword frequency analysis within these groups revealed nuanced insights:

-   **Group 1** primarily focused on \[Top 3 Keywords for Group 1\].

-   **Group 2** had a concentration on \[Top 3 Keywords for Group 2\].

-   **Group 3** emphasized on \[Top 3 Keywords for Group 3\].

(Note: Replace the placeholders \[Top 3 Keywords for Group X\] with actual keywords from the earlier analysis.)

#### 5. Visual Representation:

-   **Histogram**: A histogram showcased the distribution of scores, indicating the concentration of terms in the higher score range.

-   **Word Cloud**: A word cloud visualization highlighted the prominence of certain keywords in the dataset, with size indicating frequency.

#### 6. Potential Areas of Interest:

-   Certain keywords like "自由" (freedom) appear prominently across groups, indicating their universal appeal or significance.

-   The majority of terms have a score above 9.0, pointing towards a generally favorable or positive sentiment.

#### Conclusion:

The EDA on **`cleaned_data_r1.csv`** has unveiled several insights into the nature and themes of the terms. The data leans towards positivity, with particular emphasis on certain key themes. These insights can provide a foundational understanding for further in-depth analysis, modeling, or strategic decision-making based on the dataset's context.

Note: The above report provides a structured summary based on the EDA activities we've conducted thus far. It's essential to adjust or expand upon these findings if more in-depth analysis or additional insights were gleaned from the data.
